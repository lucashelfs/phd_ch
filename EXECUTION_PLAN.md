**Date**: January 2025  
**Project**: phData MLE Challenge Implementation  

## Executive Summary

### Project Objectives
Deploy a production-ready REST API for real estate price prediction using a pre-trained KNeighborsRegressor model. The system must demonstrate enterprise-grade patterns including scalability, maintainability, and operational excellence while maintaining simplicity in initial implementation.

### Success Criteria
- REST API serving predictions with sub-200ms response times
- Horizontal scalability through stateless design
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
- Comprehensive error handling and observability
- Production-ready containerization
- Automated testing and validation

### Technical Approach
Implement a FastAPI-based microservice with clean architecture patterns, emphasizing separation of concerns, dependency injection, and comprehensive validation. Utilize industry-standard containerization with multi-stage builds for optimal performance and security.

## System Architecture

### API Design Patterns

**RESTful Design Principles**
- Resource-based URLs with clear hierarchies
- HTTP status codes for semantic responses
- Idempotent operations where applicable
- Comprehensive error response schemas

**Versioning Strategy**
- URL-based versioning (`/v1/`, `/v2/`) for explicit contract management
- Backward compatibility maintenance across versions
- Deprecation lifecycle with clear migration paths
- Version-specific response metadata

**Endpoint Architecture**
```
GET  /health                    # System health and readiness
GET  /metrics                   # Operational metrics (future)
GET  /v1/info                   # API version and model information
POST /v1/predict                # Full feature prediction
POST /v1/predict/minimal        # Core features only (bonus requirement)
```

### Data Flow Architecture

**Request Processing Pipeline**
1. **Input Validation**: Pydantic schema validation with comprehensive error messages
2. **Data Enrichment**: Zipcode-based demographic data joining
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform input to model-expected format
4. **Prediction**: Model inference with error handling
5. **Response Formatting**: Structured JSON with metadata

**Data Dependencies**
- Model artifacts: `model.pkl`, `model_features.json`
- Reference data: `zipcode_demographics.csv`
- Input validation: Schema-driven with fallback handling

### Scalability Considerations

**Horizontal Scaling Design**
- Stateless application architecture
- Model loaded at startup (shared across requests)
- No session state or request correlation
- Load balancer compatible with health checks

**Performance Optimization**
- Async request handling with FastAPI
- Efficient pandas operations for data joining
- Model prediction caching strategies (future enhancement)
- Connection pooling for external dependencies

**Resource Management**
- Memory-efficient model loading
- Graceful degradation under load
- Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Comprehensive logging without performance impact
